              We started building this site with the idea of exploring in our
              minds. All we wanted was freedom of mind, we wanted users to find
              what they truly wanted. We wanted them to have it in their
              life-cycle, the need of finding out about new stuff all over the
              world, when they drank their coffee in the morning or preparing
              dinner for the ones they love. We talked and shared minds for days
              until we realized people already have these kind of resorces, that
              were good but never enough. We decided instantly that, that is
              what we should give them.

              Have you ever visited site after site not knowing what you want?
              We did too. The truth is sometimes you can't seem to realize what
              your mind is craving for. That is why our site offers you to
              explore it. In our site you can either see up-to-date content
              based on your interests or search whatever it is in your mind that
              makes you want to explore! :) You can choose which websites you
              want to hear from, you can checkout the time you spent exploring
              on each topic, get many random content daily and... .{" "}
